# Smart Hydropower System ⚡💧

This repository contains the design, simulation files, Arduino/NodeMCU codes, and circuit diagrams for our **Smart Hydropower System** project.  
Developed as a final year project at **UET Taxila (Department of Electrical Engineering)**, July 2020.

## 📖 Project Overview
The Smart Hydropower System is designed to provide a **stable and uninterrupted power supply** with IoT-based monitoring.  
Key features include:
- **Voltage & Frequency Stabilization** using feedback control (servo + pump regulation).
- **IoT Monitoring** via NodeMCU ESP8266 and Curics.com dashboard.
- **Uninterrupted Power Supply** with battery backup integration.
- **Fault Detection & Alerts** (smoke/fire alarms).
- **Turbine Design & Simulation** (Pelton turbine, stepper motor generator).

## 🛠️ Hardware & Components
- Pelton Turbine (3D-printed design)
- Stepper Motor as Generator
- Arduino UNO (control unit)
- ESP8266 NodeMCU (Wi-Fi module)
- ACS712 Current Sensor
- 20x4 LCD
- Servo Motor
